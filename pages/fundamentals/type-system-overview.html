<h1>Go Type System Overview</h1>

<p>
This article will introduce all kinds of types in Go and the concepts regarding
Go type system. Without knowing these fundamental concepts, it is hard to have
a thorough understanding of Go.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Basic Types</h3>

<div>
Built-in basic types in Go have been also introduced in
<a href="basic-types-and-value-literals.html">built-in basic types
and basic value literals</a>.
For completeness of the current article, these built-in basic types
are re-listed here.
<ul>
<li>Built-in string type: <code>string</code>.</li>
<li>Built-in boolean type: <code>bool</code>.</li>
<li>Built-in numeric types:
	<ul>
	<li><code>int8</code>, <code>uint8</code> (<code>byte</code>), <code>int16</code>, <code>uint16</code>, <code>int32</code> (<code>rune</code>), <code>uint32</code>, <code>int64</code>, <code>uint64</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>uint</code>, <code>uintptr</code>.</li>
	<li><code>float32</code>, <code>float64</code>.</li>
	<li><code>complex64</code>, <code>complex128</code>.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note, <code>byte</code> is a built-in alias of <code>uint8</code>,
and <code>rune</code> is a built-in alias of <code>int32</code>.
We can also declare custom type aliases (see below).
</p>

<p>
Except <a href="string.html">string types</a>,
Go 101 article series will not try to explain more on other basic types.
</p>

<p>
The 17 built-in basic types are predeclared types.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Concept: Composite Types</h3>

<div>
Go supports the following composite types:
<ul>
<li><a href="pointer.html">pointer types</a> - C pointer alike.</li>
<li><a href="struct.html">struct types</a> - C struct alike.</li>
<li><a href="function.html">function types</a> - functions are first-class types in Go.</li>
<li><a href="container.html">container types</a>:
	<ul>
	<li>array types - fixed-length container types.</li>
	<li>slice type - dynamic-length and dynamic-capacity container types.</li>
	<li>map types - maps are associative arrays (or dictionaries). The standard Go compiler implements maps as hashtables.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="channel.html">channel types</a> - channels are used to synchronize data among goroutines (the green threads in Go).</li>
<li><a href="interface.html">interface types</a> - interfaces play a key role in reflection and polymorphism.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
Unnamed composite types may be denoted by their respective type literals.
Following are some literal representation examples of all kinds of unnamed composite types
(name and unnamed types will be explained below).
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// Assume T is an arbitrary type and Tkey is
// a type supporting comparison (== and !=).

*T         // a pointer type
[5]T       // an array type
[]T        // a slice type
map[Tkey]T // a map type

// a struct type
struct {
	name string
	age  int
}

// a function type
func(int) (bool, string)

// an interface type
interface {
	Method0(string) int
	Method1() (int, bool)
}

// some channel types
chan T
chan<- T
<-chan T
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<a href="#types-not-support-comparison">Comparable and incomparable types</a> will be explained below.
</p>
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="type-kinds"></a>
<h3>Fact: Kinds of Types</h3>

<p>
Each of the above mentioned basic and composite types corresponds to one kind of types.
Besides these kinds, the unsafe pointer types introduced in the
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe"><code>unsafe</code> standard package</a>
also belong to one kind of types in Go.
So, up to now (Go 1.20), Go has 26 kinds of types.
</p>

<a class="anchor" id="type-definition"></a>
<h3>Syntax: Type Definitions</h3>

<p><i>
(<b>Type definition</b>, or type definition declaration,
initially called <b>type declaration</b>, was the only type declaration way before Go 1.9.
Since Go 1.9, type definition has become one of two forms of type declarations.
The new form is called <b>type alias declaration</b>,
which will be introduced in a section below.)
</i></p>

<div>
In Go, we can define new types by using the following form.
In the syntax, <code>type</code> is a keyword.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// Define a solo new type.
type NewTypeName SourceType

// Define multiple new types together.
type (
	NewTypeName1 SourceType1
	NewTypeName2 SourceType2
)
</code></pre>

<p>
New type names must be identifiers.
But please note that, type names declared at package level can't be <a href="packages-and-imports.html#init"><code>init</code></a>.
This is the same for the following introduced type alias names.
</p>

<p>
The second type declaration in the above example includes two type specifications.
If a type declaration contains more than one type specification,
the type specifications must be enclosed within a pair of <code>()</code>.
</p>

<div>
Note,
<ul>
<li>
	a new defined type and its respective source type in type definitions
	are two distinct types.
</li>
<li>
	two types defined in two type definitions are always two distinct types.
</li>
<li>
	the new defined type and the source type will share the same
	underlying type (see below for the definition of underlying types),
	and their values can be converted to each other.
</li>
<li>
	types can be defined within function bodies.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

Some type definition examples:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// The following new defined and source types are all
// basic types. The source types are all predeclared.
type (
	MyInt int
	Age   int
	Text  string
)

// The following new defined and source types are all
// composite types. The source types are all unnamed.
type IntPtr *int
type Book struct{author, title string; pages int}
type Convert func(in0 int, in1 bool)(out0 int, out1 string)
type StringArray [5]string
type StringSlice []string

func f() {
	// The names of the three defined types
	// can be only used within the function.
	type PersonAge map[string]int
	type MessageQueue chan string
	type Reader interface{Read([]byte) int}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Please note that,
from Go 1.9 to Go 1.17, the Go specification ever thought predeclared
built-in types are defined types.
But since Go 1.18, the Go specificaiton clarifies that
predeclared built-in types are not defined types.
</p>
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="generic-type"></a>
<h3>Concept: Custom Generic Types and Instantiated Types</h3>

<div>
<p>
Since Go 1.18, Go has supported custom generic types (and functions).
A generic type must be instantiated to be used as value types.
</p>

<p>
A generic type is a defined type and its instantiated types are named types
(named types are explained in the next section).
</p>

<p>
The other two important concepts in custom generics are constraints and type parameters.
</p>

<p>
This book doesn't talk about custom generics in detail.
Please read the <a href="https://go101.org/generics/101.html">Go Generics 101</a> book
on how to declare and use generic types and functions.
</p>

</div>

<a class="anchor" id="named-type"></a>
<h3>Concept: Named Types vs. Unnamed Types</h3>

<div>

<p>
Before Go 1.9, the terminology <b>named type</b> is defined accurately in Go specification.
A named type was defined as a type that is represented by an identifier.
Along with the custom type alias feature introduced in Go 1.9 (see the next section),
the <b>named type</b> terminology was ever removed from Go specification
and it was replaced by the <b>defined type</b> terminology.
Since Go 1.18, along with the introduction of custom generics,
the <b>named type</b> terminology has been added back to Go specification.
</p>

A named type may be

<ul>
<li>
	a predeclared type;
</li>
<li>
	a defined (non-custom-generic) type;
</li>
<li>
	an instantiated type (of a generic type);
</li>
<li>
	a type parameter type (used in custom generics).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other value types are called unnamed types.
An unnamed type must be a composite type (not vice versa).
</p>

</div>

<a class="anchor" id="type-alias"></a>
<h3>Syntax: Type Alias Declarations</h3>

<div>
Since Go 1.9, we can declare custom type aliases by using the following syntax.
The syntax of alias declaration is much like type definition,
but please note there is a <code>=</code> in each type alias specification.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type (
	Name = string
	Age  = int
)

type table = map[string]int
type Table = map[Name]Age
</code></pre>

<p>
Type alias names must be identifiers.
Like type definitions, type aliases can also be declared within function bodies.
</p>

<div>
A type name (or literal) and its aliases all denote an identical type.
By the above declarations, <code>Name</code> is an alias of <code>string</code>,
so both denote the same type.
The same applies to the other three pairs of type notations (either names or literals):
<ul>
<li>
	<code>Age</code> and <code>int</code>
</li>
<li>
	<code>table</code> and <code>map[string]int</code>
</li>
<li>
	<code>Table</code> and <code>map[Name]Age</code>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
In fact, the literals <code>map[string]int</code>
and <code>map[Name]Age</code> also both denote the same type.
So, similarly, aliases <code>table</code> and <code>Table</code> also denote the same type.
</p>

<p>
Note, although a type alias always has a name, it might denote an unnamed type.
For example, the <code>table</code> and <code>Table</code> aliases both
denote the same unnamed type <code>map[string]int</code>. 
</p>

</div>

<a class="anchor" id="underlying-type"></a>
<h3>Concept: Underlying Types</h3>

<div>
In Go, each type has an underlying type. Rules:
<ul>
<li>for built-in types, the respective underlying types are themselves.</li>
<li>for the <code>Pointer</code> type defined in the <code>unsafe</code> standard code package,
	its underlying type is itself (at least we can think so. In fact, the underlying type
	of the <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> type is not well documented. We can also think
	the underlying type is <code>*T</code>, where <code>T</code> represents an arbitrary type).
	<code>unsafe.Pointer</code> is also viewed as a built-in type.</li>
<li>the underlying type of an unnamed type, which must be a composite type, is itself.</li>
<li>in a type declaration, the newly declared type and the source type have the same underlying type.</li>
</ul>

Examples:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// The underlying types of the following ones are both int.
type (
	MyInt int
	Age   MyInt
)

// The following new types have different underlying types.
type (
	IntSlice   []int   // underlying type is []int
	MyIntSlice []MyInt // underlying type is []MyInt
	AgeSlice   []Age   // underlying type is []Age
)

// The underlying types of []Age, Ages, and AgeSlice
// are all the unnamed type []Age.
type Ages AgeSlice
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
How can an underlying type be traced given a user declared type?
The rule is, when a built-in basic type or an unnamed type is met, the tracing should be stopped.
Take the type declarations shown above as examples, let's trace their underlying types.
</p>

<pre>
MyInt → int
Age → MyInt → int
IntSlice → []int
MyIntSlice → []MyInt <span style="color:#aaa">→ <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">[]int</span></span>
AgeSlice → []Age <span style="color:#aaa">→ <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">[]MyInt</span></span> <span style="color:#aaa">→ <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">[]int</span></span>
Ages → AgeSlice → []Age <span style="color:#aaa">→ <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">[]MyInt</span></span> <span style="color:#aaa">→ <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">[]int</span></span>
</pre>

<p>

</p>

In Go,
<ul>
<li>types whose underlying types are <code>bool</code> are called <b>boolean types</b>;</li>
<li>types whose underlying types are any of the built-in integer types are called <b>integer types</b>;</li>
<li>types whose underlying types are either <code>float32</code> or <code>float64</code> are called <b>floating-point types</b>;</li>
<li>types whose underlying types are either <code>complex64</code> or <code>complex128</code> are called <b>complex types</b>;</li>
<li>integer, floating-point and complex types are also called <b>numeric types</b>;</li>
<li>types whose underlying types are <code>string</code> are called <b>string types</b>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The concept of underlying type plays an important role in
<a href="value-conversions-assignments-and-comparisons.html">value conversions, assignments and comparisons in Go</a>.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Values</h3>

<p>
An instance of a type is called a 'value' of the type.
Values of the same type share some common properties.
A type may have many values. One of them is the zero value of the type.
</p>

<p>
Each type has a zero value, which can be viewed as the default value of the type.
The predeclared <code>nil</code> identifier can used to represent
zero values of slices, maps, functions, channels,
pointers (including type-unsafe pointers) and interfaces.
For more information on <code>nil</code>, please read <a href="nil.html">nil in Go</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are several kinds of value representation forms in code, including
<a href="basic-types-and-value-literals.html">literals</a>,
<a href="constants-and-variables.html#constant">named constants</a>,
<a href="constants-and-variables.html#variable">variables</a> and
<a href="expressions-and-statements.html">expressions</a>,
though the former three can be viewed as special cases of the latter one.
</p>

<p>
A value can be <a href="constants-and-variables.html#untyped-value">typed or untyped</a>.
</p>

<p>
All kinds of basic value literals have been introduced in the article
<a href="basic-types-and-value-literals.html">basic types and basic value literals</a>.
There are two more kinds of literals in Go, composite literals and function literals.
</p>

<p>
Function literals, as the name implies, are used to represent function values.
A <a href="function-declarations-and-calls.html#declaration">function declaration
</a> is composed of a function literal and an identifier (the function name).
</p>

<p>
Composite literals are used to represent values of struct types
and container types (arrays, slices and maps),
Please read <a href="struct.html">structs in Go</a>
and <a href="container.html">containers in Go</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
There are no literals to represent values of pointers, channels and interfaces.
</p>

<a class="anchor" id="value-part"></a>
<h3>Concept: Value Parts</h3>

<p>
At run time, many values are stored somewhere in memory.
In Go, each of such values has a direct part.
However, some of them have one or more indirect parts.
Each value part occupies a continuous memory segment.
The indirect underlying parts of a value are referenced
by its direct part through (<a href="pointer.html">safe</a>
or <a href="unsafe.html">unsafe</a>) pointers.
</p>

<p>
The terminology <a href="value-part.html"><b>value part</b></a> is not defined in Go specification.
It is just used in Go 101 to make some explanations simpler
and help Go programmers understand Go types and values better.
</p>

<a class="anchor" id="value-size"></a>
<h3>Concept: Value Sizes</h3>

<p>
When a value is stored in memory, the number of bytes occupied
by the direct part of the value is called the size of the value.
As all values of the same type have the same value size,
we often simply call this the size of the type.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>Sizeof</code> function in the <code>unsafe</code>
standard package to get the size of any value.
</p>

<p>
Go specification doesn't specify value size requirements for non-numeric types.
The requirements for value sizes of all kinds of basic numeric types
are listed in the article
<a href="basic-types-and-value-literals.html">basic types and basic value
literals</a>.
</p>

<a class="anchor" id="pointer-base-type"></a>
<h3>Concept: Base Type of a Pointer Type</h3>

<p>
For a pointer type, assume its underlying type can be denoted as <code>*T</code>
in literal, then <code>T</code> is called the base type of the pointer type.
</p>

<p>
More information on pointer types and values can be found in the article
<a href="pointer.html">pointers in Go</a>.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Fields of a Struct Type</h3>

<div>
A struct type consists a collection of member variable declarations.
Each of the member variable declarations is called a "field" of the struct type.
For example, the following struct type <code>Book</code> has
three fields, <code>author</code>, <code>title</code> and <code>pages</code>.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	author string
	title  string
	pages  int
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
More information on struct types and values can be found in the article
<a href="struct.html">structs in Go</a>.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Signature of Function Types</h3>

<p>
The signature of a function type is composed of
the input parameter definition list and
the output result definition list of the function.
</p>

<p>
The function name and body are not parts of a function signature.
Parameter and result types are important for a function signature,
but parameter and result names are not important.
</p>

<p>
Please read <a href="function.html">functions in Go</a> for more details
on function types and function values.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Methods and Method Set of a Type</h3>

<p>
In Go, some types can have <a href="method.html">methods</a>.
Methods can also be called member functions.
The method set of a type is composed of all the methods of the type.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Dynamic Type and Dynamic Value of an Interface Value</h3>

<p>
Interface values are values whose types are interface types.
</p>

<p>
Each interface value can box a non-interface value in it.
The value boxed in an interface value is called the dynamic value of the interface value.
The type of the dynamic value is called the dynamic type of the interface value.
An interface value boxing nothing is a zero interface value.
A zero interface value has neither a dynamic value nor a dynamic type.
</p>

<p>
An interface type can specify zero or several methods, which form the method set of the interface type.
</p>

<p>
If the method set of a type, which is either an interface type or a non-interface type,
is the super set of the method set of an interface type, we say the type
<a href="interface.html#implementation">implements</a> the interface type.
</p>

<p>
For more about interface types and values,
please read <a href="interface.html">interfaces in Go</a>.
</p>

<a class="anchor" id="concrete-type"></a>
<h3>Concept: Concrete Value and Concrete Type of a Value</h3>

<p>
For a (typed) non-interface value, its concrete value is itself and its concrete type is the type of the value.
</p>

<p>
A zero interface value has neither concrete type nor concrete value.
For a non-zero interface value, its concrete value is its dynamic value and its concrete type is its dynamic type.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Container Types</h3>

<p>
Arrays, slices and maps can be viewed as formal container types.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, string and channel types can also be viewed as container types informally.
</p>

<p>
Each value of a formal or informal container type has a length.
</p>

<p>
More information on formal container types and values can be found in the
article <a href="container.html">containers in Go</a>.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Key Type of a Map Type</h3>

<p>
If the underlying type of a map type can be denoted as <code>map[Tkey]T</code>,
then <code>Tkey</code> is called the key type of the map type.
<code>Tkey</code> must be a comparable type (see below).
</p>

<h3>Concept: Element Type of a Container Type</h3>

<div>
The types of the elements stored in values of a container type must be identical.
The identical type of the elements is called the element type of the container type.
<ul>
<li>For an array type, if its underlying type is <code>[N]T</code>, then its element type is <code>T</code>.</li>
<li>For a slice type, if its underlying type is <code>[]T</code>, then its element type is <code>T</code>.</li>
<li>For a map type, if its underlying type is <code>map[Tkey]T</code>, then its element type is <code>T</code>.</li>
<li>For a channel type, if its underlying type is <code>chan T</code>, <code>chan&lt;- T</code> or <code>&lt;-chan T</code>, then its element type is <code>T</code>.</li>
<li>The element type of any string type is always <code>byte</code> (a.k.a. <code>uint8</code>).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Concept: Directions of Channel Types</h3>

<div>
Channel values can be viewed as synchronized first-in-first-out (FIFO) queues.
Channel types and values have directions.
<ul>
<li>
	A channel value which is both sendable and receivable is called
	a bidirectional channel. Its type is called a bidirectional channel type.
	The underlying types of bidirectional channel types are denoted by the <code>chan T</code> literal.
</li>
<li>
	A channel value which is only sendable is called
	a send-only channel. Its type is called a send-only channel type.
	Send-only channel types are denoted by the <code>chan&lt;- T</code> literal.
</li>
<li>
	A channel value which is only receivable is called
	a receive-only channel. Its type is called a receive-only channel type.
	Receive-only channel types are denoted by the <code>&lt;-chan T</code> literal.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
More information on channel types and values can be found in the article
<a href="channel.html">channels in Go</a>.
</p>

<a class="anchor" id="types-not-support-comparison"></a>
<h3>Fact: Types Which Support or Don't Support Comparisons</h3>

<div>
Currently (Go 1.20), Go doesn't support comparisons
(with the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators)
for values of the following types:
<ul>
<li>slice types</li>
<li>map types</li>
<li>function types</li>
<li>
any struct type with a field whose type is incomparable
and any array type which element type is incomparable.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Above listed types are called incomparable types.
All other types are called comparable types.
Compilers forbid comparing two values of incomparable types.
</p>

<p>
Note, incomparable types are also called uncomparable types in many articles.
</p>

<p>
The key type of any map type must be a comparable type.
</p>

<p>
We can learn more about the detailed rules of comparisons from the article
<a href="value-conversions-assignments-and-comparisons.html#comparison-rules">value conversions,
assignments and comparisons in Go</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Fact: Object-Oriented Programming in Go</h3>

<div>
Go is not a full-featured object-oriented programming language,
but Go really supports some object-oriented programming elements.
Please read the following listed articles for details:
<ul>
<li>
	<a href="method.html">methods in Go</a>.
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Fact: Generics in Go</h3>

<p>
Before Go 1.18, the generic functionalities in Go were limited to built-in types and functions.
Since Go 1.18, custom generics has already been supported.
Please read the <a href="generic.html">generics in Go</a> article for built-in generics
and the <a href="https://go101.org/generics/101.html">Go Generics 101</a> book for custom generics.
